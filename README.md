# School District Analysis

## Overview
The City School Board has assigned us with categorizing and analyzing the standardized testing results for 15 schools in order to better understand their performances based on school size, budget, type of school, and more. From this analysis, the board will make decisions on budget allocation for the schools and which schools should be prioritized based on their performance. However, there was recent evidence of academic dishonesty from the Thomas High School for its ninth graders' reading and math scores. This has prompted us to replace the test score data from Thomas High School's ninth graders with NaNs. Thus, we have recoded our script in order to reflect this and will present the newly calculated results.

We worked with the following resources to generate the results:

Data Source: schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv
Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook

## School District Analysis Summary
To account for the academic dishonesty in the ninth grade test results from Thomas High School, we made four key amendments to the original script.
